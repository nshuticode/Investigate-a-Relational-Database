# Investigate-a-Relational-Database
Investigate a Relational Database - The Sakila Database  (The first project from Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python)

The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. 
For this project, I queried data from the database to gain an understanding of the customer base.

In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. 
You wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answered interesting questions about the database. 
I run SQL queries and built visualizations to showcase the output of My queries.

Interesting questions asked:
1. What are the most rented movie categories? 
2. What are the top 3 categories that make huge money? 
3. What are the top five countries which have the highest sales? 
4. List the 5 best customer their contacts and address ? 

Data Base Used: PostgreSQL database.
